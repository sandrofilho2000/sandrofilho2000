### ðŸ‘‰Hi There, I'm Sandro Filho.

**I'm a young web dev student looking foward to my first professional experience as a Front-End developer**


  In the middle of a pandemic, I took a decision that would lead me to where I'm right now. In April 2020 I decided to explore this universe called I.T by trying to code in **Python**. I followed a channel called Curso em video and coded all the 115 proposed practical exercises. Doing this, I had all I needed to pick the front-end path so I had my first contact with **HTML5, CSS3** and **JS**. Months late I had a back-end background as well, I have coded in Technologies such as PHP and MySQL. 
  
  
### What am I doing at the momentðŸ¤”?

  Recently, I joined a course called *Full Stack Master* from **Danki Code** where I am developing several practical exercises and getting to know a wide world of new technologies e languages
